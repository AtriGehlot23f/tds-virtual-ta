What is it for?\n\n\nThe larger goal of the Discourse forum is to act as a Knowledge base for the course. You can make this more productive by\n\nElaborating your question sufficiently and supporting it with steps that you have already tried at your end before posting this question\n\nSharing additional content or explanations related to the topic being discussed\n\n-  Are there any rules for posting in this category?\n\n\nBefore you create a new post, review the existing threads to see if there are already highly similar or identical postings. Discourse will suggest similar posts once you start typing titles\n\nTag the post appropriately so that it gets indexed correctly in our Knowledge Base. For instance, if your query is on an Activity Question in Week 1 then use the tags #activity-question, #week-1\n\nProvide a meaningful title to your post that contains the topic/details of your query so that it can be searched by others easily. For instance: Do not use the titles like \u201cAQ1.1 Q3\u201d which just gives question number alone. Instead use a more meaningful title like - \u201cNeed help in calculating the \n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc61\n\u210e\nN\nth\n prime number\u201d\n\nType in your question and explanations rather than pasting images or screenshots.\n\n- What is NOT Permitted in this category?\n\n\nBeing argumentative or sarcastic\n\nUse of abusive/strong language\n\nPosting support/logistics related query\n\nUnnecessarily tagging Faculty/Instructors in posts\n\nPosting Solutions or discussing solutions to graded assignments\n\n- Who will be moderating the content in this forum?\n\n\nThe foum will be moderated by Course Instructors. They will have the authority to decide whether a post violates forum rules/guidelines. You can flag/report any such violations that you observe by clicking on  icon on the post. Please do mention the reason why you are flagging the topic.\n\n  - What are the disciplinary actions if some one violates the rules and guidelines of the forum? \n\n\nThe flagged posts that violates forum rules/guidelines will be hidden.

So I checked the available models using:\n\nllm model list\n\n\nAt that point, the Gemini model wasn\u2019t listed.\n\nI then installed the llm-openrouter plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I\u2019m now facing the above authentication error.\n\nTo test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn\u2019t need any credits to be purchased)\n\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free\n\n\nThis worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine.\n\nI\u2019m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the llm CLI. I\u2019ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven\u2019t been able to resolve this.\nCertainly! Here\u2019s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end:\n\nI also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin llm-openrouter), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the llm documentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this:\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\n\nHowever, even this approach didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nCould you kindly guide me on how to resolve this issue?\n\nThank you for your time and help.\n\nSincerely,\nMeikanda Sivam\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n39\nviews"

This inconsistency has resulted in a correct answer being marked as incorrect, despite the fact that the same query was previously accepted by the evaluation script of Graded Assignment without any issue. Such ambiguity in the evaluation process is concerning and leads to confusion and unfair penalization of students.\n\nI respectfully request that you review this matter and ensure that the evaluation criteria are consistent across the evaluation scripts. Denying marks due to technical discrepancies in the evaluation scripts, rather than the correctness of the SQL query itself, is unjust. This issue has severe repercussions: If unresolved, it will unjustly lower my overall course grade despite submitting a correct solution. Such an outcome, resulting from no fault of my own, is deeply concerning and undermines the fairness of the evaluation process.

I have completed all subjects in Diploma and I am experienced in programming so it went well for me. But students who are doing this subject early in their Diploma will find it pretty difficult especially Project 2 . So, one suggestion would be to add prerequisites for this subject and suggest them to take TDS in their last term.\n\nThe End Term was easy but there was no point on adding a question to calculate a lengthy expression manually to calculate distance.

Oh how wrong was I!!\n\nThe sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it\u2019s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I\u2019ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.\n\n@s.anand sir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.\n\n@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions.\n\nI still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I\u2019d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms.\n\nThanks\nRegards,\nShivaditya Bhattacharya\n\n\n\n10\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n228\nviews\n39\nlikes\nread\n4 min\nSummarize"

I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\n\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\n\n1000042547\n1080\u00d7578 187 KB\n\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter \u201cPOST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays\u201d\n\nTo filter such logs, we need:\n\nTime \u2192 for the hour and the day (Monday)\nMethod \u2192 to filter POST\nURL \u2192 to filter /images/\n\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\n\n Time, Method, URL\n\nTime \u2192 needed \nMethod \u2192 needed \nURL \u2192 needed \nReferer \u2192 not needed, but not harmful\n\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra \u2014 which doesn\u2019t invalidate it.\n\n1000042548\n1080\u00d7301 71.5 KB\n\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\n\nStatus is numeric (200)\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\n\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\n\nThe other options were as follows:\n\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n\n9824 has no critical issue \u2014 it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n\n1000042545\n1079\u00d7468 35.7 KB\n\nCorrect Answer(s):\n\n PUT \u2013 Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\n\n GET \u2013 Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\n\n DELETE \u2013 Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\n\nIncorrect Answer:\n\n POST \u2013 Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\n\nThank you\n\n\n\n6\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n301\nviews\n17\nlikes\n1\nlink"

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\n\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)\n\nGA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n\n2. Project Updates\nProject 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link)\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\n\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nLakshay\n\n\n\n Solved by carlton in post #3\nMarked as solved by lakshaygarg654\nThe course is in transition.

    "text": "23ds1000034\nJul 2024\n\nHello Sir, @s.anand @carlton\n\nAs TDS is one of the most important courses in the data science diploma, I respectfully want to bring up a concern. The TDS roe exam is almost impossible to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a statement by your side\u2026\n\nMy question is, why is this exam graded and carrying 20% weightage towards the final grade? Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this exam ungraded or reduce its weightage. This is a very serious issue, as many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n\n\n Solved by carlton in post #3\nMarked as solved by Amit1\n@23ds1000034 @nandanreddyp TDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly penalises you.

    "text": "A_LAKSHMI\n1\nFeb 25\n\nDear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi\n\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n\nKey Challenges Faced\n Lack of Prerequisites\n\nThis course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students\u2014including those from non-technical backgrounds\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n\n Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure\n\nThe difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n\n Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\n\nMany students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for working professionals and students without prior experience.\n\n Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\n\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\n\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\n\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\n\n\n\n85\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n543\nviews\n157\nlikes\n16\nlinks\n16\nusers\nread\n5 min"

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\n\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\n\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\n\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\n\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\n\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n37\nviews\n1\nlink"

    "text": "24f2006531\nJan 31\n\nIs it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\n\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\n\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\n\n\n\n2 Replies\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n37\nviews"

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\n\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\n\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this.\n\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.\n\n\n\n4\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n53\nviews"

    "text": "22f3002811\nDec 2024\n\nDear Tds team @carlton @jkmadathil @Bharathi @andrew ,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I would like to clarify my position and outline the key concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2.\n\nFirstly, let me emphasize that I have no issue with the discussion, learning objectives, or goals of the project. In fact, I thoroughly enjoy challenges and have appreciated this course more than any other in the diploma program. However, there is a clear distinction between engaging in academic exploration and the critical impact of grading, which directly influences our final results.\n\nNow, addressing the core issue:\n\nAttached below is a screenshot of the final evaluation results:\n\n\nimage\n1918\u00d7983 109 KB\n\nThese evaluation fields, which were hidden during the final evaluation, significantly affected (and, in my case, diminished) my final score. For instance:\n\nReadMe Evaluation:\nHow did the LLM determine that my ReadMe file lacked the necessary headings or structure? This judgment appears inconsistent and lacks transparency.\nChart Relevance:\nHow did the LLM evaluate the relevance of the charts in my submission? The charts I provided were entirely aligned with the project goals.\n\nimage\n1412\u00d7969 104 KB\n\nFor reference, my submission can be reviewed here: GitHub Repository.\n\nTo explore alternative evaluation methods, if peer review had been used, I believe it is reasonable to estimate that my final score would have ranged between 80-90%. This aligns with the initial evaluation script, which scored my submission at 89% (14/14).\n\n\nThis created a false sense of confidence for many students, myself included, that our scripts were adequately optimized and would receive a decent grade (as the evaluation script used llm to determine the final grade for test cases and it took a lot of time to take it from 4/14 to 14/14). This lack of transparency in the evaluation process led to confusion and ultimately to disappointment when the final grades were released.\n\nCritical Concerns:\n\nTransparency:\nHow do you justify the drastic reduction of a score from 89% (based on the initial evaluation) to a mere 41% in the final evaluation? This inconsistency undermines the credibility of the grading system.\nIntegrity:\nThe final evaluation process appears to have serious flaws. A peer review would likely have produced a score closer to 90%, which is far more representative of the effort and quality of the submission. The current system\u2019s inability to provide consistent and reliable results is concerning.\nImpact on Grades:\nThe abrupt decline in scores has directly impacted our final grade points, in some cases, reducing them from a \u2018B\u2019 to a \u2018C.\u2019 This disproportionately penalizes students and fails to reflect their genuine efforts.\n\nProposed Solutions:\n\nReevaluate all submissions using a new and fair evaluation script (though I understand this might not be feasible at this stage).\nImplement a peer review system to provide more accurate and balanced grading.\nAccept the initial test results (14/14 scores) as the final results. While this may be a basic measure, it is at least consistent and reflective of the criteria we optimized our scripts for.\n\nWhat cannot be done, however, is ignoring the evident flaws in the evaluation system. Students invested weeks optimizing their scripts (from scores like 4/14 to 14/14) based on the visible tests, only to be blindsided by a system that ultimately did not function as intended.\n\nWhile I am not opposed to new evaluation systems or changes, it is essential that such systems work transparently and consistently to ensure fairness for all students.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.\n\nSincerely,\nAditya Gupta\n\n\n\n8\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n136\nviews\n1\nlink"

    "text": "22f3002811\n1\nDec 2024\n\nDear Tds team , @andrew @Bharathi @Milo ,\n\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of Project 2 for the TDS course. Several aspects of the grading process have raised serious issues of fairness, transparency, and academic integrity, which are causing undue stress among students.\n\nFirstly, the evaluation matrices appear to be biased and disproportionately harsh. For instance, even scripts that scored as high as 89 in visible test cases were unable to solve the hidden cases, with no explanation provided for the failure. This lack of feedback makes it impossible for students to understand or address their mistakes, leading to significant frustration.\n\nAdditionally, the overall scores do not seem to accurately reflect the quality or efficiency of the submitted scripts. Many students have put in substantial effort to write optimized and functional code, only to receive grades that undermine their hard work. The lack of transparency in how the final grades are determined further exacerbates this issue.\n\nThis project\u2019s grading has had an outsized impact on the overall course grade, jeopardizing the academic standing of many students. Such a disproportionate weight on one project, coupled with an unusually high level of complexity this term, has made it exceedingly difficult for students to achieve even a decent grade. This has resulted in feelings of humiliation and distress.\n\nI kindly request that the department reviews the evaluation process for Project 2, providing greater transparency in scoring, a more balanced weighting for grades, and constructive feedback on hidden test cases. This would ensure a fairer assessment of students\u2019 efforts and capabilities.\n\nI hope you will consider the concerns raised here and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. I, along with my peers, am willing to discuss this matter further if required.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nAditya Gupta\nTDS Course Participant\n\n\n\n1 Reply\n21\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n411\nviews\n52\nlikes\n8\nlinks\n6\nusers\nread\n9 min"

Many of us diligently followed the instructions provided, especially those shared on the GitHub page, only to find that the actual grading criteria seemed unclear at the time of submission.\n\nFurthermore, when running the evaluation code locally, several students, including myself, consistently obtained scores between 80 to 100 marks. However, the dashboard reflects significantly lower marks\u2014for instance, I received only 15. This inconsistency raises questions about the evaluation process and its alignment with the guidelines we followed.\n\nThis lack of clarity has left many students dissatisfied with their marks, as the results do not align with the effort invested and the feedback received during project evaluation sessions. I believe it would be beneficial for the course team to review this issue and provide more transparent grading rubrics for future projects.\n\ns.anand\ncarlton\nandrew\n\n\n\n30\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n325\nviews\n84\nlikes\n14\nusers"

    "text": "s.anand\nCourse_faculty\n8\nDec 2024\n\nTDS Project 2 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-2-automated-analysis.md at tds-2024-t3 \u00b7 sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public \u00b7 GitHub\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting project.\n\nYou have to write an LLM-based program to analyze a dataset.\nYou have to convince an LLM that your code and output are good.\n\nThis is hard. It\u2019s something you haven\u2019t done before. (Nor most people in the world.)\n\nSo I strongly urge you to start early!\n\nPlease use this thread for any questions.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn a lot of new things. Enjoy the journey!\n\nUPDATE: 7 Dec 2024. The WIP evaluation script is at tools-in-data-science-public/project2 at tds-2024-t3-project2-wip \u00b7 sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public \u00b7 GitHub\n\nUPDATE: 12 Dec 2024. Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen is Project 2 due? Before Mon 16 Dec 2024,3:30 pm IST.\nWhere do I submit? https://forms.gle/r2sNJvGicxrhE9mYA\nCan I use my own OpenAI API key? Yes\nWhere should I store the token? In the AI_PROXY environment variable. Don\u2019t commit your token.\nWhat if I ran out of the $2 credit on my token? We\u2019ve increased it to $5 for everyone. You will not get more. Borrow from friends if required.\nHow do I check how much credit I have used so far? Every response has a monthlyCost field. Keep that below 5.0.\nWon\u2019t passing images to OpenAI cost too much? Use \"detail\": \"low\" to reduce it.\nWhat should my folder structure be?\nautolysis.py\ngoodreads/README.md\ngoodreads/*.png\nhappiness/README.md\nhappiness/*.png\nmedia/README.md\nmedia/*.png\nHow should I run my autolysis.py? uv run autolysis.py /path/to/input.csv\nWhere should I save the README.md and PNG files? In the current working directory.\nHow can I check my submission? Use the WIP Project 2 Evaluation Script.\nWhere are the results of this stored?\nLinux/Mac: ~/.local/share/tds-sep-24-project-2/results.csv\nWindows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\tds\\tds-sep-24-project-2\\results.csv\nLLMs are error prone. Should my code retry on failure? Yes. E.g. use a library like tenacity.\nWill you evaluate the code multiple times and take an average? No. Just once.\nHow long can my code run? Max 120 seconds.\nWhat if I get CLONE FAILED ... returned non-zero exit status 128.? Your GitHub repo URL is wrong or your repo is private.\nWhich datasets will you evaluate? The project mentions \u201cone of the datasets you submitted\u201d. We\u2019ll run uv run autolysis.py on either goodreads.csv, happiness.csv, or media.csv, randomly, and evaluate it. We will also evaluate it on 2 secret datasets.\nI get a No module named .... Read the uv reading material\nI get a HTTP 429 error. OpenAI is tired. Retry.\nI get a different score each evaluation. LLMs give different results each time. Make your code and prompts more robust.\n\nUPDATE: 14 Dec 2024. More FAQs\n\nBut my code works on my system\u2026 It needs to work via the evaluate script too. This project teaches you portable and deployable coding.\nBut it worked last time\u2026 APIs are unreliable. Learn how to handle that, e.g. via retries, caching, timeouts, etc.\nBut I got a different score last time\u2026 LLMs are not deterministic. Learn how to handle that, e.g. via robust prompts.\nBut my code times out\u2026 Shorten your prompts. Reduce the number of LLM requests. Pray for luck.\nWhat\u2019s the max total from the evaluation script? 14 when you run it. When I run it, it\u2019ll add 2 extra datasets taking the total to 20. (Plus 8 bonus marks for originality and 4 for wow factor. Finally, normalization.)\nWhat if the code evaluation gives me contradictory feedback? The final code evaluation script is a secret. It\u2019ll be far more granular. Use the evaluation output as a guide but focus on writing good code.\nHow do I handle No module named ...? Read the Project 2 reading material on uv\nShould I pip install my dependencies? No. Read the Project 2 reading material on uv\nWhere should I save my generated README.md and PNG files?. In the current directory, NOT the script directory, nor the data directory.\nHow do I handle Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer...? Use http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1 as your OPENAI_API_BASE when using the openai library with AIProxy\nI have a Readme.md but the evaluation script script says I dont. File names will be evaluated case-sensitively. Create a README.md and *.png in exactly that case.\n\nUPDATE: 15 Dec 2024. Second submission evaluation.\n\nI\u2019ve evaluated 343 Project 2 submissions starting around 4 pm IST today.\n\nOf these, 151 got 3/3, and these are PROBABLY OK. Others may copy your code. You might improve & test it locally for uniqueness and push before the deadline.\n\nThe remaining 192 submissions are not OK.\n\nThe evaluation is based on this evaluation script: tools-in-data-science-public/project2 at tds-2024-t3 \u00b7 sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public \u00b7 GitHub\n\nThe results are at: TDS Sep 2024 - Project 2 Evaluation 2024-12-15 - Google Drive\n\nresults.csv has the status of the submission checks for each student. If your ID is not here, then you have not submitted with your IITM email. Please submit again.\n\nlogs/ has the logs, i.e. your code output (if there was any). I run the evaluator 2-3 times since I ran out of tokens. So some of you may see the output of two runs.\n\nThe top problems I see are:\n\nSaving files in the script or data directory instead of the current working directory.\nNot using script metadata for uv, or trying to install via pip\nScript runs forever. NOT due to LLMs, but waiting for interactive visualizations, starting HTTP servers, etc.\nAI Proxy token is not set up correctly.\n\nThese are classic deployment mistakes. Please fix them.\n\nSome of your repos are private. I guess you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nI won\u2019t be able to run more evaluations before the deadline, nor revert on this thread, given travel. I suggest you run the evaluation script (preferably without Python in the path, with the data in a faraway directory) to check if your code works.\n\nTDS 2024 Sep Project 2 Results\n\nView Project 2 results.\n\nThis is the evaluation process.\n\nAnalyzing the results.csv will be interesting. Please do share your analysis and learnings.\n\nFAQ\nBut I get different results locally. ANS: Your code ran differently in the test environment. LLMs and environments are not deterministic. Write code more robustly.\nWhat\u2019s fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled? ANS: Your repo is private.\nWhat\u2019s missing autolysis.py? ANS: Your script was not named autolysis.py and present in the root folder. Maybe it had a different name or was in a different folder.\nWhy\u2019s my README.md or *.png missing? ANS: Your script didn\u2019t generate them, or saved them in a wrong location.\nWhy do output: wage_theft.csv, output: house_rent.csv get 0 points? ANS: They are not part of the evaluation. They\u2019re just an informational check.\nWhat is code_hacking? ANS: The code has content that nudges the LLM towards higher code quality scores? This does not affect your score, but re-runs the evaluation.\nWhat is output_hacking? ANS: The output has content that nudges the LLM towards higher output quality scores. That gives you a tiny bonus and re-runs the evaluation.\nWhy does it praise my score and still give me 0? ANS: The prompt instructs it to always tell you what\u2019s good AND bad, irrespective of the score.\nHow was the code diversity bonus calculated? ANS: Using the % overlap (Jaccard similarity) with previous submissions. Bonus = Your marks * (1 - overlap) * 8 / 20\nWhat about the \u201cEngaging and interesting\u201d bonus? ANS: None of the responses blew my mind. (Oh, there are very good ones, no doubt.) So I didn\u2019t award any for this.\n\nThis concludes the Project 2 evaluation.\n\nFantastic work, everyone!!\n\n\n\n8\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\nProject 1 results\n4.3k\nviews\n152\nlikes\n50+\nlinks\n134\nusers\nread\n53 min\nTop replies"

I think the issue lies that many with environment variable AI_PROXY_TOKEN got their submissions evaluated. But in mail it was told to use AI_PROXY as the environment variable. I am not against anyone but because of this evaluation my result is lagging behind and I got very less marks. I am attaching the images with this. Kindly see into it and try to give me a resolution or clear my doubts about it.\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-12-26 at 12.00.58 PM\n1748\u00d7612 156 KB\n\n\nScreenshot 2024-12-26 at 12.02.01 PM\n1994\u00d7874 118 KB\n\n\n\n Solved by Jivraj in post #2\nMarked as solved by Jivraj\n[image] This is part of your code, you are trying to retrieve dictionary key value pair, which is wrong way.

    "text": "22f3001493\nDec 2024\n\nDear TDS Team,\nThroughout the course, from the foundation/qualifiers stage, we have been trained to rely on timely email notifications for upcoming events, exams, and other key activities. We receive multiple reminders for assignment submissions, SCTs, exam registrations, hall tickets, live sessions, etc. For exams specifically, we have always received hall tickets with proper prior notification.\n\nHowever, for the TDS ROE, the only email we received was on the day of the exam itself, asking us to appear for it without any prior intimation. This lack of communication creates significant challenges, especially for working professionals, who often need to plan their schedules well in advance. Such uncoordinated planning is not feasible unless one happens to be unoccupied on that day by sheer luck.\n\nThis is the first exam conducted without hall tickets which I was not even aware of this or no information available about this in any form.\n\nIn online course, proper communication and timely reminders are absolutely critical to ensure participants can attend the exams effectively.\n\nI see this as an operational failure rather than an issue of students forgetting to set reminders for important dates.\n\nI completely missed this exam due to a lack of awareness about the date and time. May be the case with most of students who missed the exam. Due to this, I have direct impact on my grade.\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n77\nviews"

    "text": "carlton\nRegular\n1\nAug 2024\nChatGPT\nChatGPT\n\nA conversational AI system that listens, learns, and challenges\n\nYou can use this GPT for all TDS related questions as it has been uploaded with the course content. We have used it for generating Mock Question Papers and the End Term Question paper as well. Please send us feedback so we can continue to fine tune it.\n\nThe following was completely generated by the TDS GPT TA:\n\nDear Students,\n\nI\u2019m here to assist you as a Teaching Assistant (TA) throughout this course. My role is to help you navigate through the various concepts, assignments, and tools that you\u2019ll be exploring.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI am ChatGPT, a virtual assistant designed to support your learning journey. My primary purpose is to guide you as you work through the course material, assist with your questions about assignments, and help you develop a deep understanding of data science tools. Here\u2019s a quick overview of what I can do for you:\n\nWhat I Can Do:\nGuided Problem-Solving: I\u2019ll help you break down complex problems into manageable parts. I\u2019ll ask questions to guide your thinking, suggest strategies, and help you find the best approaches to solve problems. Remember, I won\u2019t give you direct answers but will guide you toward finding them yourself.\nConcept Clarification: If you\u2019re stuck on a concept, I can help explain it in simpler terms. Whether it\u2019s data analysis, visualization, or machine learning, feel free to ask for help in understanding the material.\nPython and Excel Support: I can provide tips, code snippets, and suggestions on how to use Python and Excel to solve data science problems. However, I encourage you to experiment and try out your solutions.\nAssignment Guidance: I can guide you through your assignments by helping you interpret the questions, offering insights into possible approaches, and discussing relevant concepts. Please note that the order of questions may vary, so share the full question and options when asking for help.\nMy Limits:\nNo Direct Answers: I\u2019m here to foster your learning, not to give you direct answers. My goal is to help you think critically and develop problem-solving skills.\nNo Grading Assistance: I cannot comment on or influence your grades. If you have any concerns about grading, please reach out to your course instructors directly.\nEncouragement of Independent Learning: While I\u2019m here to help, I strongly encourage you to attempt problems on your own first. Struggling with a problem is a key part of the learning process!\nContextual Understanding: I may sometimes need more context to provide accurate help. If I ask for more details, it\u2019s to ensure I\u2019m guiding you in the right direction.\nHow to Use My Support:\nBe Specific: When you ask a question, provide as much detail as possible. This helps me give you the most relevant guidance.\nEngage in the Process: Use my suggestions as a starting point. Explore, experiment, and iterate on your solutions.\nAsk Follow-up Questions: If my guidance isn\u2019t clear or if you need more help, don\u2019t hesitate to ask follow-up questions.\n\nI\u2019m excited to be part of your journey in this course! Together, we\u2019ll explore the fascinating world of data science and its powerful tools. Feel free to reach out whenever you need help.\n\nLooking forward to working with you all!\n\nBest regards,\nChatGPT\nTeaching Assistant - Tools in Data Science (TDS)\n\n\n\n15\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\nTDS May 2024 Portal Resource Links\nEnd Term Mock Issue\n443\nviews\n21\nlikes\n3\nlinks"

It was meant to be 25/10/2024 23:59 Hrs, however it was unintentionally closed at 5.29am.\n\nPlease rest assured, there are at least three alternative proposals being considered to mitigate this mistake on our part. Our goal is to make the restitution as painless as possible but also fair to those that submitted their assignments early. If you submitted early the full assignment we will still consider it for grading (aka you filled up all the answers).\n\n[UPDATE: 31 Oct 2024]\nThe requirement for end term eligibility will be dropped from best 3 of first 5\nto best 2 of first 5 graded assignments.\n\nLikewise, the best 4 of 7 graded assignments will be considered for graded assignment score for the T value.\n\nPlease note Project is separate from Graded Assignments. Project is not part of the eligibility requirements nor is it part of the GA score calculation. Project has its own weight and contribution to the T score.\n\nWe will inform you of the resolution in a couple of days time. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please prepare for your upcoming quiz and all the best for it.\n\nKind regards\n\n\n\n4\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\nUnable to answer GA-4 assignment\nGA 4 is deadline is Preclosed?\nThe deadline for GA-4 submission\nGA 4 Deadline before time?\nIssue with week 4 assignment deadline\n2 more\n507\nviews\n8\nlikes\n5\nlinks"

List the license_name in order, comma-separated.\n\nIn Q3, based on my scraped data, I got:\n\nNaN\nmit\napache-2.0\nothers\ngpl-3.0\n\n\nas top 5 most popular license.\nAs it\u2019s written in the question Ignore missing licenses, so I am left with mit,apache-2.0,others combination.\n\nBut, if I am submitting this, it\u2019s showing incorrect and null,mit,apache-2.0 are being considered correct.\n\nimage\n752\u00d7182 16.6 KB\n\nQ6. Which programming language is the second most popular among users who joined after 2020?\n\nIt is asking for second most popular language, but it\u2019s accepting the first popular language.\n\nI am getting following as output for languages with their count (popularity) for users who joined after 2020:\n\nlanguage\nPython              10\nNaN                  9\nHTML                 6\nTypeScript           5\nC++                  3\nJavaScript           3\nJupyter Notebook     3\nAstro                2\nVue                  2\nC#                   2\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nIt should accept HTML, but it\u2019s accepting Python.\n\n\nimage\n739\u00d7182 13.4 KB\n\nQ12. Do hireable users follow more people than those who are not hireable?\n\nFor Q12 as well as Q15, it\u2019s not accepting the numeric value, marking it as incorrect (I\u2019ve tried several ways, got same value again and again), it is marking NaN as correct.\n\nimage\n739\u00d7182 21.3 KB\n\n\nimage\n739\u00d7182 20.2 KB\n\nRegarding these 2 questions, there might be some issue in my users.csv, but I am not sure of, because I am getting number as a result while executing Python code. Please clarify this.\n\nPlease clarify these issues sir.\n\nAlso, If any other student has got same Quiz ID: Beijing:500, please confirm whether this is happening to you as well, or it\u2019s an issue from my end (csv file data ambiguity).\n\nThank you,\nParampreet Singh\n\n\n\n1\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n168\nviews"

    "text": "lifelonglearner\nOct 2024\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Once you have the code in place and have received the API response in CSV format, you upload those CSVs to GitHub and start answering the questions. When you reach questions 11, 12, 13, and 15, you start wondering where things are going wrong. After reviewing all the hints, I realized that the code checking your answer treats \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d as strings. If you check the file uploaded on GitHub and look at the raw version, you\u2019ll see that it has everything stored as either TRUE/FALSE or True/False. Opening the file on your machine doesn\u2019t help, because Excel automatically interprets these values as booleans.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did\u2014not the best method, and I\u2019m sure someone could code a solution, but I did the best I could. I copied the raw file content from GitHub and pasted it into a Word document. I replaced all instances of FALSE with false and TRUE with true, then copied that back into the GitHub raw file and committed the changes.\n\nOnce done, return to the project page and enter the same answers you initially got through your code or manual calculations, and you\u2019ll see things align. I know this isn\u2019t the most elegant solution, and I should handle it programmatically, but sometimes you have to implement fixes that work rather than seeking the most elegant solution. Hope this helps!\n\n\n\n1\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n83\nviews"

I am moderately comfortable with Python (although I haven\u2019t done it, I\u2019m fairly confident I can get at least a B in PDSA if I do it now; using specific libraries is an entirely different question). Regarding Excel, most things used in BDM should be fine for me. Now comes the HTML and JavaScript part. I can read and understand some pure HTML code and make static pages without any bells and whistles\u2014which more or less amounts to nothing, as it will just look like an average LaTeX document. I know nothing about Java or JavaScript. Now, dropping the course is not really a good option for me due to some personal reasons. Hence, I\u2019m thinking of just learning what\u2019s needed on the go. I am sure there will be others in a similar situation too.\n\nThings being what they are (I didn\u2019t know about these prerequisites early enough, so I didn\u2019t prepare during the three-week gap after the last term exams), can you please suggest some references\u2014documents, books, articles, sites, or YouTube playlists\u2014for getting started in the best possible way? It would have been nice if such content were curated and added as Week 0\u2014MLF has a Week 0 where they list out some topics from statistics and mathematics.\n\nIt would be helpful if the resources are divided into categories like:\n\nMinimal to get going, and can learn more as needed\nAll that we need\n\nIf it can also be structured like these concepts would be used in week n; knowing this concept will provide better insights, it would be great.\n\nTL;DR\nPlease provide some structured resources for the prerequisites, such as articles, documents, books, or YouTube playlists.\n\nThanks for any help and your time. \n\n\n\n Solved by carlton in post #2\nMarked as solved by s.anand\nHi Hari, Please refer to the course introduction page. Most students ignore this page, but for TDS it is a source of very valuable information.

For those that want fat free info:\n\nTDS is practical.\nREAD the Course Introduction LOTs of invaluable Information.\nStart preparing for ROE NOW.\nEnd term is theory based and is much easier than GAs, Projects, ROE.\nProject Score = 80% based on answers to project questions + 20% are from Peer Reviews.\nProject comprises of Quantitative and Qualitative. Peer reviews are on the qualitative part. Reviews that are outliers are rejected.\nBonus Marks are only on Discourse. Answers must be submitted according to the Discourse post. Discretion of Bonus Marks are upto how impressed the Prof is with your submission.\nBonus Marks are really worth it. In total they are worth half of the total GAs.\nAlso Bonus Marks are great fun!\nROE Mocks are just previous ROEs.\nThere is no pattern for ROEs. They are never the same as previous ROEs.\nHowever core skills of ROEs remain the same:\n\nScraping webpages. HTML, CSS, Javascript (particularly for selecting dom elements), sessions, cookies.\nScrapping PDFs. Python Tabula library.\nPython (especially Pandas)\nNominatim\nSQL\nand maybe some other minor tools.\n\nROE week content: Week 2 to 4\nROE is open book (not proctored, use anything you wish including GPT)\nROE is very, very hard. Start preparing now.\nSCT is NOT required for ROE.\n\nWeek 5: you will get some $ allowance for LLM tokens. Awesome. And super fun topic.\n\nOptional Videos in week 2 are NOT optional. They are a necessary for ROE (and end term).\n\nBonus 1: Making LLM app: Just sharing the code on Github is not an app. Github and Github Pages are NOT the same thing. Github Pages is a web server where you can deploy your app. Github repo is just a place to store and share your code. An app is a working application that anyone with web access can use just by clicking on the link you provide.\n\nYour app has to be submitted in the Discourse post where the Bonus post was made.\n\nSubscribe to Discourse emails for TDS. That way you will not miss important information like the Bonus questions.\n\nListen to Podcast - very informational about current data science industry.\n\nBASH - there is a great book for this from System Commands.\n\naccounts.google.com\nGoogle Drive: Sign-in\n\nAccess Google Drive with a Google account (for personal use) or Google Workspace account (for business use).\n\nThe links at the bottom and top of videos in the modules are very valuable.\n\nWeek 1 Video session is available on the TDS You Tube Video Playlist.\n\n\nAccess will NOT be given to the video links in the calendar. The ONLY place to get access to the videos will be the TDS You Tube Video Channel.\n\nKind regards,\nTDS TA\n\n\n\n7\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\nAccess for TA session recording - 29 Sep\n142\nviews\n3\nlinks"

We are able to see any test runs that were submitted. We want to reassure you, if you did your \"Test Run\", then your last \"Test Run\" submission will still be considered.\nIf you encountered the above problem or any other portal problems, please send some evidence of the problem you encountered in this discourse thread. This will help the operations team to diagnose why this error occurred. Screenshots, error messages, etc would be helpful. Please keep everything in a single post per student (i.e do not make multiple post submissions)\n\nPlease use the poll below to indicate your issue and provide a detailed response as a reply to this post.\n\n I was unable to click on \u201cSubmit\u201d button, but I was able to click on \u201cTest Run\u201d\n I was neither able to click on \u201cSubmit\u201d nor \u201cTest Run\u201d\n I had a different issue\n13\nvoters\n Votes are public.\nResults\nRegarding submission issues related to Peer Reviews for Project 1\nClarification\nPeer Review submission = You submit for review from others + You review submission given by others\n\nAnd there is a causal link between these two, i.e., you submit for getting review from others and hence you receive and hence you get an opportunity to review others. It should not be treated as mutually independent events\n\nThe opportunity being provided now is for those who faced technical issues in either of the parts and due to which they were unable to submit.\n\nOn  Friday, August 9, 2024 12:00 PM, we will open the peer review submissions for Project 1 and this will be open till  Saturday, August 10, 2024 12:00 PM. The reviews will have to be subsequently completed by  Sunday, August 11, 2024 12:00 PM. This will be your last window to submit your part 2 submission and its peer reviews. If you encounter any problems on the day, please get straight away in touch with us through this discourse thread, so that the operations team can in real time evaluate the problem that you are encountering and get you a resolution.\nIf you are unable to access the review submissions due to insufficient access privileges, give a zero for that review and move on to the next review.\nLikewise please ensure that your project folder has been given full access permissions to \u201cAnyone with the link\u201d. Otherwise you will get a 0 from other reviewers.\nIf you have concerns about getting bad reviews, please read the Course introduction page, a clear detailed explanation is given with regards to how we handle anomalous reviews. So do not worry about it. Please do not fill up discourse with complaints about peer reviews. We have a mechanism to deal with it fairly. If on the other hand you have received 100% when you should not have\u2026 be ready to be evaluated fairly too. It cuts both ways.\nAlso, please note that we will be considering the marks for only those who had submission issues for the part 2 assignments earlier. In case you have already received your reviews, we will not be considering your review score for this assignment. In case you missed out on reviewing others in the earlier submission, reviewing as part of current submission will not fetch you marks.\n\nEdit: Updated the nature of submission to include both Part 2 submission and its peer review and detailed out the cases that will be considered for final mark calculation.\n\n\n\n2 Replies\n1\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n[Urgent] Peer Grading Review\nIs it a glitch\n564\nviews\n6\nlinks\n22\nusers\nread\n5 min"

    "text": "Kartik1\nSep 2024\n\nThis course never fails to surprise us, whether it was the impossible ROE exam, the easiest end term exam or the sarcastic posts and responses from TA\u2019s and the professor.\n\nI want to take a minute to appreciate and thank the entire TDS team for this amazing course and for their efforts in teaching us in a fun and challenging way. I don\u2019t know whether i will score good or not in this course but by far this was the most enlightening course i have ever taken in this degree.\n\nThe course content was very well designed and it taught us the tools in data science in most practical way possible. Learning from @s.anand Sir felt like learning from some data science wizard, his ways made me think about data storytelling from a whole new perspective and also helped me in doing some data analytics projects for my resume.\n\nA special thanks to @carlton , for replying to each and every query/doubt on this course from the day 1, looking at someone putting in so much efforts motivates us to do better.\n\nGoodbye, TDS !\n\n\n\n12\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n162\nviews\n20\nlikes"

    "text": "22f1000001\nSep 2024\n\n@carlton\n\nHey there!\nHope you\u2019re having a wonderful day. I am reaching out to you with a rather strange request regarding project 2. Despite completing my project without much issues, a submission error (I was unaware of) occurred, and my csv file did not get submitted as I expected. And I just noticed this error (today, literally now) as I\u2019ve been busy with end term prep.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve explained my bit, my request is that would it be possible to go through my project to just evaluate my work and provide feedback? Since grading ended on the 25th, I know providing grading would be next to impossible. But just to understand my errors and rectify it in the future would one of the TA\u2019s or instructors be able to help me figure out errors in my project 2?\n\nI would really appreciate it if I was granted with such an opportunity. I just want to understand my errors before moving onto my upcoming courses. Do let me know if this would be possible. If its a positive response, I don\u2019t mind sharing my questions and answers here.\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n76\nviews"

You\u2019ll both learn faster.\nAsk ChatGPT. LLMs help you think. It\u2019s good to practice with AI anyway.\nAsk your TAs. Try solving / learning it yourself, first.\nTry again later. Give it a few days, sleep over it, and try again.\n\nWhen are live / TA sessions?\n\nLive sessions are on Wednesdays at 9 pm IST from 12 June. TA sessions are on Thursdays and Sundays at 8 pm IST from 13 June. See the course calendar. The link is on the course introduction\n\nShould I leave questions blank if I don\u2019t know the answer?\n\nNo. There is no negative marking. Guess smartly for more marks.\n\nIn GA1, 75 students left an answer blank! One student got 3 questions right and left 7 blank (out of 10). It\u2019s very likely they\u2019d get 2 more marks from guessing.\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nEdit\n647\nviews\n6\nlikes\n3\nlinks\n7\nusers"

    "text": "iitmanupam\nAug 2024\n\nHello @s.anand. There was a post yesterday from @carlton regarding the end term exam (link provided below):\n\n Syllabus and Tips for End Term TDS \nTools in Data Science\nSyllabus: All 9 modules, All videos Weightage: Roughly equal weightage for all 9 modules Questions: Between 40 to 60 questions Exam time: 1.5 hours Questions will be all brand new set. None from previous PYQs. Kind regards\n\nSince there are a lot of new elements introduced in the course this time and the exam pattern is changing (maybe similar to May 23 ET?), it would be really helpful if we could understand which apps/tools we should cover to manage our prep for the end term.\n\nI ask this because nearly each week lists out a number of tools and apps in the videos. Most of them are mentioned from a utility perspective and it is left up to the student to read up more on the said tools/apps. I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is a way to make the end term exam less open-ended (because it is not open-book like the ROE).\n\nAny advice (including a specific list of tools/apps) would be most helpful.\n\n\n\n Solved by s.anand in post #6\nMarked as solved by iitmanupam\n@carlton and @dibujohn \u2013 why don\u2019t you sharing the step-by-step process on how you crafted the final exam questions? I personally thought the process was fascinating. The more enthusiastic people could replicate the process and get a feel for the kind of questions they\u2019d see (and potentially share\u2026\n7\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n558\nviews\n42\nlikes\n6\nlinks\n8\nusers"

Even if you didn\u2019t appear for it, you\u2019re allowed this time, and there\u2019s nothing to lose.\nIf you got 0/8 or 1/8, retake it. Even random guesses could improve your score.\nIf you got 2/8 or 3/8, join the ROE, look at the questions and decide. If you feel lucky, go ahead.\nIf you got 4/8 or above, don\u2019t bother. Your score will likely go down.\n\nIf you join the ROE, accept the code of conduct, and DO NOT CLICK ANY ANSWER, this ROE score won\u2019t count. You\u2019re welcome to browse the questions.\n\nIf you join the ROE, accept the code of conduct, and CLICK ON EVEN ONE ANSWER even accidentally, your score WILL count and WILL replace your previous ROE score.\n\nA few tips:\n\nThe questions are similar to the earlier ROE but are on a different dataset. Those who answered the last ROE have a slight advantage, so I\u2019ve made the questions slightly harder. (\u201cYeah, as if the last ROE wasn\u2019t hard enough! \u201d)\nThere\u2019s an annoying alert \u201cYou are not allowed to switch tabs/windows\u201d that\u2019ll appear. Sorry.

Your responses weren\u2019t auto-submitted. Our mistake.\n\nPlease be gentle on the TAs. This is an operational miss. They spotted it early, but it wasn\u2019t fixed on time.\n\nYou now have the OPTION of taking another ROE on Sun 28 July at 4:00 pm IST for 45 min.\n\nThis ROE will be just like the previous one. Same difficulty. Same syllabus. But different datasets and slightly different techniques.\n\nIf you take this 2nd ROE, ONLY the 2nd ROE score will be used (not the best of the two).\n\nIf you don\u2019t take this 2nd ROE, your 1st ROE score will be used (or zero if you didn\u2019t take/submit the first one.)\n\nThis ROE will be on the exam portal. Your answers will be auto-saved. (The exam portal is usually proctored, but this exam won\u2019t be. Use the Internet, friends, whatever. If the portal warns not to open other tabs or windows, ignore them.)\n\nThere will be a G-Meet and a Discourse thread active during the ROE to resolve issues quicker. They\u2019re optional. Join either if you have a query.\n\nTo avoid overloading you, we\u2019ll space things out a bit.\n\nGA6 & GA7 will be released Mon 29 Jul, after the 2nd ROE.\nProject 1 submission is extended to Wed 24 Jul. Peer reviews are due by Fri 31 Jul.\nProject 2 submission will be released on Mon 5 Aug. Submission is due on Mon 19 Aug.

Peer reviewer 2, assigned to my project, has only marked q1 and q2 despite both being available and accessible in the link.\n\nAdditionally, reviewer 1 has cut marks for placing outliers wrongly in q1, which is not the case (pic attached for reference - please let me know if I\u2019m wrong and marks should be cut). He has also cut marks for depicting the same scatter plot in two ways (linear and log plot) in my inference report for q2. I wondered if this was also a marking criterion, as this was not mentioned and seems to have been inferred by the reviewer alone. I have included the same scatter plots in 2 different manners - to make the inference report easier to analyze. I should not be penalised for this as I have followed all rules and regulations for the project to the T.\n\nimage\n905\u00d7296 17.6 KB\n\n\nimage\n935\u00d7406 23.3 KB\n\n\nimage\n809\u00d7481 63.1 KB\n\n\nimage\n805\u00d7423 74.9 KB\n\n\n\n@carlton @Amit1 @s.anand I just wanted to ask if the marks they gave are the final ones.

    "text": "21f3001724\nJul 2024\n\nI initially wrote a much longer much rantier version of this, but having calmed down somewhat, my thoughts on the 3 submissions I\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nQ1\n\nTo begin with, the point headers for both documents - the cleanup document & the inferences document, are 100% identical for question 1 across all 3 of the submissions I\u2019ve graded so far.\n\nRegarding the inferences, I feel like there\u2019s a quantity vs quality issue here. IF I were grading you on the actual strength of your inferences, I don\u2019t want 11 points that just say \u201cwell here\u2019s what we see in the chart\u201d. I could just look at the chart to get that.\nI want 1 - 3 points that you think through. You should start a point with \u201cthis phenomenon can be observed in the chart\u201d, and then you should spend a paragraph or 2 exploring, hypothesizing why it happened, considering what it could possibly mean.\n\nRegarding the data cleanup. You guys again just copy-pasted the exact same document which you got from God knows where, and for \u201cbonus points\u201d some of you included code snippets. And while you did cleanup every possible issue, that\u2019s my problem.\n\nNo one said \u201cI inspected the data, found so & so issues were present, and addressed those issues specifically before getting on with my work\u201d. Whoever made this document thought to themselves \u201chere\u2019s every possible issue that this dataset could have actually contained as per the live sessions and discourse posts, look I handled all of them\u2026even if some were not present in my state\u2019s data\u201d.\n\nMore problematically no one described at all anything they did to the state dataset after scraping & cleaning; no one wrote \u201cnow I made a pivot table with this as rows & this as columns & this as values to get the data in the format I needed to solve the question\u201d.\n\nAlso why did none of the charts have chart titles? I haven\u2019t reduced any gradings for this cuz the axes were labelled & titled, but come on this is just basics, include a title saying \u201cplot of no. of times @21f3001724 has lost his temper and nearly given himself a heart attack\u201d.\nOtherwise, how would I as a client or independent reviewer even know what I was looking at if I had not also solved this project?\n\nQ2\nQuestion2 was sligthly less migraine inducing to read, mainly cuz I don\u2019t think anyone made an inferences.docx template for it and so you guys needed to actually write something of your own (and look at the shock, even when I can tell the writer is not too confident with writing their own stuff, when they actually excercise their brains and try the results aren\u2019t half bad).\n\nProbably the funnniest part was when someone (you know who you are\u2026unless multiple of you did this thing) copied the inferences point headers from Question 1 and then wrote things like (I\u2019m paraphrasing)\n\n\u201c21st century shift - there is none because this is not time series data\u201d\n Why would you mention that then?\n\n\nimage\n750\u00d71000 60 KB\n\nYou might think \u201chey my written reports are lackluster but that\u2019s not my job I\u2019m a data analyst I did the data analyzing part right?\u201d\nWell first off I don\u2019t really care, and second off I\u2019d say it does matter. Because my issue here is not \u201cthe report was badly written\u201d. My issue here is that it was lazily written.\n\nIf was a professor, and a student came to me and gave me a report, and I saw it was full of spelling errors & grammatical errors, but that it was clearly something they had written with their own mind and which was the work of their own hands, I would vent my temper (cuz I\u2019m self aware enough to know I\u2019d still be angry) by highlighting every last error & failure, & then I\u2019d say \u201cGood job. Glad to see something YOU have written\u201d.\n\nBut if 3 students came to me, and I saw they had not even bothered to change the point headers between them, I would grab their submissions and rip them to shreds in front of their eyes.\n\nYes ChatGPT and asking for help from friends are valuable tools to make up for your shortcomings. But remember, you are not here to pretend you do not have shortcomings, you are here to remedy them. You suck at writing? All the more reason to try to write. If its still too terrible to submit, fine, feed it to ChatGPT and say \u201cmake this pretty for me, and tell me what you did so that next time I can try to do those improvements\u201d.\n\nYou have no idea what to include in the document? By all means refer to what someone else has done. Look at it, think for a bit, and say \u201coh ok I get the idea\u201d. And then write something yourself. For most of my writing-based submissions in 12th grade, I had reference. But they were reference. I may have copied the formatting if I thought a style of pointer or font was good looking & aesthetic, but that was it. My words were my own. My work was my own.\n\n\n\n1 Reply\n5\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n152\nviews\n20\nlikes\n6\nusers\nread\n4 min"

Since this is not best of 2 so I want to know if I just visit the portal and solve questions without selecting any options would that mean I will get 0 in 2nd ROE and then it would get counted towards my score?\n\nThanks & Regards,\nSwati Jain\n\n\n\n Solved by 21f3000759 in post #2\nMarked as solved by 21f3000759\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n62\nviews"

At 8:45, when I attempted to submit my answers by clicking the submit button, the system failed to respond, and the cursor kept scrolling. I recorded a video as proof, which clearly shows that I had marked all answers except for the fourth question. Additionally, three of my answers were correct.\n\nUnfortunately, when I reloaded the portal, I discovered that my responses had not been saved. I am deeply disappointed that the portal did not have an auto-save feature and lacked a visible timer, and also it was showing 21:00 on the portal, but after reloading, it showed 8:45, which led to my oversight in properly submitting my answers.\n\nI kindly request that you consider awarding me marks based on the three questions I answered correctly. As mentioned, I have video proof demonstrating that I completed the questions but was unable to submit them due to technical difficulties. Here are the links to the video and photo for your reference:\n\nVideo proof: [VID20240720205408.mp4 - Google Drive]\n\nI sincerely hope you will respond positively to my request and take the necessary steps to address this issue.\n\nThank you for your understanding and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Parveen]\n21f3001560\n\n\n\n12\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n120\nviews\n14\nlikes\n1\nlink"

For the  given AC_NAME, What is the latest year in which the winner won more than 50 percent of the vote? [string] -If no one got more than 50 percent of the vote, then the answer is NA \nwe can see that here the desired format for a year is string.\n\nA year could just as easily be written as a string or as text, however given the above discrepancy I wanted to confirm if Q18 is indeed asking for the year(s) which saw the max no. of outliers or was meant to simply ask for the max number of outliers\n\n\n\n1\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n31\nviews"

    "text": "AmodhNaik\nJul 2024\n\nHello all,\nA week ago I made a post asking for any entry-level tips on how to scrape the data for Project 1 as I was completely lost. Since then I have been directed to the TA Session for July 7th, which I have watched and have also independently tried using BeautifulSoup\u2019s html parser, pandas\u2019 html scanner (both of which were unable to parse the data on the site) and importing the data into excel (which I was unable to do successfully). I still am unsure as to how I am meant to scrape the data.\n\nI would once again like to iterate that I am confident in my ability to do the scraping and processing after-the-fact. I am just entirely lost on where or how to start. If anyone at all was in any way successful, I would appreciate any tips on how to start this.\n\nAdditionally, if you are using BeautifulSoup or pandas, if you found a way to navigate the various URLs from the main database page, any hints for that would also appreciated. (It might be very simple once you parse the data from the main page, but I am unaware if that is the case because that is what I am having trouble with in the first place)\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated.\n\n\n\n Solved by carlton in post #5\nMarked as solved by AmodhNaik\nHi Amodh, Do not clean up spellings of candidate names or constituency names (the nos however are not part of their name, logically). Also there may be other objective data manipulations that can be cleaned up if the dataset is logically examined. There will be no cleanups that are subjective (i.e.\u2026\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n107\nviews"

Only include constituencies and election years that had at least 1 female candidate. Each row in the correlation data table should represent an election.\n\nSince the given AC or state was not mentioned in this question, am I right to assume that we need to parse the data of the entire dataset(all states for all years) in order to calculate this?\n\nWhat I have done to get the answer for this is extract those ACs for those years where at least 1 female candidate was present. I then totaled the male and female votes for all those constituencies such that my correlation table had 2 columns - \u201cMale Total Votes\u201d and \u201cFemale Total Votes\u201d and every row was a different election(combination of constituency and year). I then calculated the correlation co-efficient on those two columns.\n\nI am unsure if I understood the question correctly, please let me know if my analysis is accurate. Thanks so much!\n\n\n\n Solved by carlton in post #2\nMarked as solved by AmodhNaik\nHi Amodh, Q17 is only for all ACs in the given State, not for the whole country (but great job!).

This cannot be it because on doing some inspection w/ pandas & excel, these 3 columns appear to have been introduced only from the 2005 elections onwards (maybe a bit sooner, my state\u2019s dataset jumps from 2000 to 2005).

Identify the candidate who had the greatest change in vote share compared to the previous election,    regardless of the gap between elections? [string]     - Do not consider NOTA as candidate (but NOTA votes are to be considered as part of the total votes)     - If no candidate has participated in two elections, then the answer will be NA     - If two candidates have the same vote share change, choose the candidate who came first alphabetically\n\nWhile spelling mistakes or phonetically sounding similar names can be handled easily, but the candidate with same names might not be the same person.\n\nThere is no unique identifier in the dataset that if a person with the same name is indeed the same person. For example, MAHARAJ SINGH stood in 1998 from BJP. In the 2008 election, another person named MAHARAJ SINGH was there from INC. There is a significant vote change but on going to Wikipedia & other sources I found these 2 were different people and only had the same name.\n\nAlso, some names may be phonetically similar but they are different people. For example, SOBARAN SINGH MAWAI and SOBRAN SINGH MAVAI both are phonetically similar but despite being in the same party they are different people. The first one contested (1977) only once while second one has contested twice(2003 & 2008). This cannot be ascertained from data.\n\nSuch things can be only found by going to external sources, while someone going through data won\u2019t know about it. I don\u2019t know how should I approach this? Please guide me.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nSwati Jain\n\n\n\n Solved by carlton in post #4\nMarked as solved by 21f3000759\nHi Swati, We were aware of some issues that were raised during Sunday TA Live session with regards to the questions.

    "text": "s.anand\nCourse_faculty\nJul 2024\n\nShort answer: It\u2019s a mistake that was intentionally left uncorrected. Ignore the words difference in.\n\nWhy did I make the mistake?\n\nOriginally, my question was about the difference between 2 Pearson correlations.\n\nSince that\u2019s time-consuming to calculate and I felt generous, I made it a single correlation.\n\nBut I forgot to remove the words difference in.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I correct it later?\n\nI remembered a client engagement. The client made an error in wording. Our team spent 8 days figuring out what the client meant. (It took just 2 days to get it done, in contrast.)\n\nSuch communication errors are common. The question is, how do we deal with them?\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nYou have 3 options.\n\nAsk. Asking gives you clarity. It requires courage and practice. But it wastes time since you need to wait (and nudge) for the answer.\nAssume. Guessing the intent and proceeding saves time. You build the skill to guess intent. But you might guess wrong.\nAssume, then ask. You don\u2019t waste time. If you get an answer, you can correct. If not, you\u2019ve done your best. Your manager / client is happy you\u2019re not lazy and still get the job done.\n\nIn most situations, including this GA, Option 3 works best. (But if you have plenty of spare time and get only one chance, Option 1 is best.)\n\nIn this case: think about what you did for this question.\n\nWhich option did you use?\nIs this your usual style?\nAre there benefits to an alternate approach?\n\nWhat does this have to do with TDS?\n\nThe best tool in data science is collaboration. (That\u2019s why TDS is mostly open Internet, open collaboration, etc.)\n\nI hope you learn to compensate for fallible faculty / managers / clients who make mistakes as often as you!\n\n\n\n10\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n39\nviews"

    "text": "21f2001345\nJun 2024\n\nData preparation according to me is the most difficult stage in the data analysis process. Here\u2019s why:\n\nTedious and Repetitive: Data preparation often involves cleaning and wrangling messy data. This can be repetitive and time-consuming, especially for large datasets. Imagine having to fix inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues in thousands of rows!\nRequires Attention to Detail: One mistake during data preparation can lead to inaccurate or misleading analysis. You need a keen eye to spot errors and ensure data quality.\nLess Glamorous: Compared to the excitement of uncovering insights or building models, data preparation might feel less glamorous. It\u2019s the groundwork that goes unseen but is crucial for successful analysis.\n\nWhile other stages have their challenges, data preparation can feel particularly troublesome because of its repetitive nature and the importance of getting it right.\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n55\nviews"

    "text": "22f3001517\nCourse TA\nJun 2024\n\nHi\nCan anyone please explain what might be the mistake in the following. This is pertaining to question 1 in my GA:\n\nI have marked the accepted answer by random choice as my output was not matching with any of the given option.\nWhat I did was the following command in the terminal:\n\ngrep '/hindi/' data \\\n | grep '\"GET' \\\n | grep -E '(^| )200( |$)' \\\n | grep '07/May\\|14/May\\|21/May\\|28/May' \\\n | awk -F: '$2 >= 15 && $2 <= 20 { print $0 }' \\\n | wc -l\n\n\nMy chain of thoughts:\nThe first grep filters for /hindi/. The output is then piped to the second grep which filters for the GET request. The third grep takes this output and filters for the response 200. The fourth grep filters for Tuesdays which for the month of May 2024 fall on 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th May.\nI found the filtering for hours a bit tricky. What I did was to use awk and used : to separate the records and filtered out those whose second field is greater or equal to 15 but less than or equal to 20, and finally the output is piped to wc which counts the number of lines.\nThis gives me the output as\n\n131\n\n\nBut applying the same logic for the second question works:\n\n\ngrep '/hindi/' data \\\n | grep '\"GET' \\\n | grep -E '(^| )200( |$)' \\\n | grep '03/May\\|10/May\\|17/May\\|24/May\\|31/May' \\\n | awk -F: '$2 >= 10 && $2 <= 19 { print $0 }' \\\n | wc -l\n\n\ngives the output\n\n253\n\n\nSo I am guessing that the command, though not optimum, does work fine.\n\nCan someone point out what might be the issue?\n\nTagging Sir @s.anand and @carlton\n\nRegards\n\n\n\n Solved by 22f3001517 in post #11\nMarked as solved by s.anand\nHi As my answer was not matching with the accepted answer in the portal, I continued looking a bit deeper.

From my understanding, this conversion of file type will result in a heavy loss of data, but I couldn\u2019t find any other solution.\nI used pandas to convert the file into a .csv file. The relevant data seemed to be intact so I then opened the file in excel and notice a significant loss in the number of rows, though they seemed to be later in the file than was necessary for either question, so I deemed that to be okay as well.\n\nAfter applying the necessary filters and formulae, the answers I got were only accurate in the first digit and I am not sure where I went wrong. I will be attaching my outputs below as best as possible as I cannot upload any files to this post.

    "text": "21f3001724\n1\nJun 2024\n\nUsually we don\u2019t ask questions about graded assignments till after their respective deadlines but my question here is not regarding what the correct answers are (I was able to get those), but more about what the optimal way to go about such a task is.\n\nFor context the questions ask us to identify the official data portal of Colombia & Peru respectively.\n\nFirst thing I tried, lifted straight from the lectures - check the awesome-public-datasets page. No dice.\n\nNext thing I tried - going to google-dataset-search, just typing Peru, seeing who uploaded each of the dataset results which showed up. Still no dice.\n\nNext thing was just googling \u201cOfficial data portal peru\u201d like a chimp. That eventually led me to the correct link but ONLY because this was an MCQ based assignment & I knew the \u201ccorrect link\u201d would be 1 of 4 options. If it were not for those mcqs in front of me, this may have been a different story. Also doesn\u2019t help that my Spanish is rudimentary at best.\n\nMy broader question is about how we find what we\u2019re looking for and also how we then figure out if we\u2019ve legitimately found what it is we were looking for, but I suspect the answer to that is a combination of \u201cpractice\u201d + \u201cexperience\u201d + \u201cdon\u2019t be stupid\u201d.\n\nSo I\u2019ll confine my question right now to asking if there\u2019s anything glaringly obvious that I did not try while trying to find the answer for these questions?\n\nMay seem like a strange question to ask, but over some of the programming diploma subjects I learnt an unfortunate side-effect of the \u201clearn by figuring large chunks of it out for yourself\u201d school of teaching, namely that you learn bad/inefficient/janky practices.\nAfter all if I\u2019m a caveman who\u2019s never seen a wheel before, and I\u2019m tasked with making a thing that rolls, I may well stop at an octagonal shaped \u201cwheel\u201d because hey that does roll; the thought of a circle won\u2019t even cross my mind.\n\nMy overall point is that left to myself I tend to go with brute force ways to solve problems that either take 8 times as much effort or (in rare cases, I usually throw enough force to negate this) don\u2019t work at all, hence my asking such questions as a countermeasure for that tendency\n\n\n\n1\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n64\nviews"

For Example there can be multiple candidates with similar name , consider each name as unique individual : Eg Chandrasekhar Rao is different from Chandra Sekhar Rao. Consider both the records as individual contestants.\n2: For Bihar, there were 2 sets of elections conducted for the same year 2005.

In cases where the number of female candidates is the same for multiple years, the answer should be the earliest year. For example, if the highest number of female candidates is 4 in both 1994 and 2005, then the answer must be 1994.\nq 4 : Margin percentage definition is given in instructions of project-1. Use that def. to calculate answer.\nQ 6 : just simple margin. not %\n\nq 14 : Which year did a party exhibit the most significant increase in vote share from one election to the next consecutive one?\nThis denotes the party that exhibited the most significant increase in vote share from one election to the next consecutive one?

In cases where the number of female candidates is the same for multiple years, the answer should be the earliest year. For example, if the highest number of female candidates is 4 in both 1994 and 2005, then the answer must be 1994.\n\nClarification 2:\nFor Bihar, there were 2 sets of elections conducted for the same year 2005. Please use the following link to access the modified dataset for easy evaluation:\n\ndocs.google.com\nassembly_dataset2_corrected\n\nassembly_dataset2.csv ST_NAME,YEAR,AC_NO,#,AC_NAME,AC_TYPE,NAME,SEX,AGE,CATEGORY,PARTY,VOTES Bihar,1951,1,1,MANER,GEN,RAMESHWAR PRASAD SHASTRI,M,NODATA,INC,8240 Bihar,1951,1,2,MANER,GEN,JAGDEO PRASAD...\n\nClarification 3:\nRegarding Q14: \u201cWhich year did the party exhibit the most significant increase in vote share from one election to the next consecutive one?\u201d The expected answer should be an integer and not a float.\n\nClarification 4:\nPlease use the dataset as it is , even when there is a minor difference in the name of candidate/party/constituency. For Example there can be multiple candidates with similar name , consider each name as unique individual :\nEg Chandrasekhar Rao is different from Chandra Sekhar Rao (or Chandrashekhar Rao). Consider both the records as individual contestants.\n\nClarification 5:\nQ14: Which year did a party exhibit the most significant increase in vote share from one election to the next consecutive one?\nThis denotes the party that exhibited the most significant increase in vote share from one election to the next consecutive one?

    "text": "21f3002763\nDec 2023\n\nDear Ma\u2019am/Sir,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a concern regarding the recent TDS Project 2 deadline, which unfortunately resulted in the loss of 20% marks for many students, including myself.\n\nAs a student currently pursuing my offline degree and concurrently interning at KPMG, my weekdays are entirely consumed by work and academic commitments. Due to this tight schedule, I regrettably overlooked the deadline for TDS Project 2, which was set for Friday, December 15. When I discovered this on Saturday, December 16, it was already too late.\n\nI would like to emphasize that the current deadline structure puts students who work or intern during the week at a significant disadvantage. In my case, I was able to secure full marks for Project 1, and I believe a similar outcome could have been achieved for Project 2 had the deadline been more accommodating.\n\nUnderstanding the challenges faced by many of my peers in juggling work and academics, I would like to kindly request a reconsideration of the TDS Project 2 deadline. Specifically, I propose extending the deadline until today night to allow those affected, including myself, the opportunity to submit our work and salvage the 20% marks.\n\nI believe that such an extension would be a fair and reasonable adjustment, considering the unique circumstances faced by students who are also engaged in professional commitments. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated, and I am confident it would contribute to a more equitable assessment process for all students.\n\n@pds_staff\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n49\nviews"

One way would be to try copying the tags into Excel, finding an intersection, and then sorting. Another way would be to just visually inspect. Another way would be to use Python to scrape.

For example, if your answer is \u201cm%\u201d, refrain from simply writing \u201cm.\u201d Instead, represent the percentage as a fraction by dividing the value by 100.\n\n\n\n4\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n89\nviews\n1\nlink"

Create a compelling story to be presented to top media houses (International / Regional / South Indian / Bollywood \u2026 depending on the Industry you wish to focus on) on what types of movies they should focus for the next 2 years so as to receive noticeable awards AND be successful in the box office. Be creative with the sources of data, different modeling and visualization techniques\n\nAnalyze different job boards to narrate a story on the hottest job titles over the past 5 years, what were the top skills in demand?, how were the salaries evolving, etc.\n\niPhone 15 is out! (I\u2019m still an Android guy btw) iPhone 14 pro max is not available at present. Flipkart Sale is going on. iPhone 15 is severely out of stock almost everywhere. Will iPhone 14 make a come back? What does history say? When a new model is launched, how does the prices of older models move around?\n\nApart from these, Anand has recorded a short video talking about some of his cool project ideas that you could take up. Will release it in the portal later in the day.\n\nAll of these project ideas have scope to be built out into course long work - adding different layers of modeling / visualization / story-telling. Hey listen, if you ever get to pitch the movie idea to some production house, don\u2019t forget to recommend me for a role eh \n\n@Gangsta123 will come up with a plan for short intro session to the basics of HTML.\n@Amit1 is already mentoring a few of you and running mentor - mentee sessions.\nPlease do get in touch with @mayurg or @sushil1 to know more about the mentorship program.\n\nTAs @Gangsta123 and @Amit1 (both, or one?) are also running live sessions every week - @Gangsta123 @Amit1 - please send out a broadcast mail to all TDS students with your schedule.\n\n\n\n12\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n333\nviews\n14\nlikes\n1\nlink"

To provide you with an analogy: This is like not accepting the students paper because he could not bring it to the examiner\u2019s desk and left it at his seat.\n\nI would humbly request you to consider the situation in the right spirit.

    "text": "Rushil\nAug 2023\n\nI was a TDS student of Jan 23 term and due to issues in the ROE of my term, we were given an opportunity to retake the TDS exam in this term for a sum of Rs. 2000. For that we had to fill a gform.\n\nI had filled the gform almost immediately but after that I received no information regarding the re-exam whatsoever. Not even information regarding the payment link was received by me and upon checking my pending payments section, the TDS ROE repeat fees were showing as expired even though I had been checking the pending payments section daily since its announcement and there was no way I could have missed it.\n\nEven before the day of the supposed re-exam, I have been raising this issue on discourse but not even the course instructor Mr. @Dixon was aware of such a re and thus he was unable to help me.\n\nOn the day of the exam I also mailed the sender of the email which had earlier informed me of this repeat ROE but I got no response from them either.\n\nI was disappointed and dejected but still I used the ROE link provided in the ROE discussion thread and attempted the ROE again alongside regular TDS students of this batch. I even ran seeya in the background.\n\nOnce my exam was over, I wrote a lengthy mail to the support team explaining all these issues and asked them that since the POD itself failed to inform me further regarding this repeat exam (which they themselves had announced by the way), will my ROE attempt be considered?\nTo this, I just now got a very simple response that no my attempt would not be considered. No further consolation, further remedy was offered to me.\n\nI am very disappointed and hurt with the people and process behind these ROE exams. Why even announce a repeat ROE when you could not care to give follow up details on the same? Why were the course instructors not even aware of such a re-exam being announced? I urge the concerned parties to provide an explanation on the same.\n\n@Puneet_21f3002005 @Dixon @Bharathi\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n166\nviews\n1\nlink"

    "text": "22ds3000111\n1\nJul 2023\n\nI want to express my disappointment with the construction of this exam paper.\n\nIt would have been highly beneficial if the exam paper had been provided in a standard file format. The given file extension, \u201cXLSB,\u201d proved to be incompatible with Google Sheets, causing obstacles when attempting to open the file online. Consequently, I opted to download the file and work offline to avoid further complications. However, as an Ubuntu user, I faced difficulties opening the file using LibreOffice Calc, the primary spreadsheet software on Ubuntu systems. Since Excel cannot be installed on Ubuntu, this led to stress and wasted time. As a result, I lost marks, which is very frustrating.\n\nFurthermore, questions 5 to 9 presented additional challenges as the Google Sheet was neither downloadable nor loading correctly. This led to substantial delays as I made repeated attempts to access it, and when I finally managed to copy the content to a new personal spreadsheet, I discovered that only \u201cDistrict = 1\u201d was present. This was incredibly frustrating and consumed half of the given time.\n\nThese issues are particularly concerning as they cover a significant portion of the exam\u2019s marks. I sincerely hope that these concerns will be taken into consideration, and a reexamination should be conducted to provide a fair opportunity for all students. or marks should be normalized among all who have faced such issues.\n\n@Dixon\n\n\n\n5\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n62\nviews"

It\u2019s okay to not answer all questions. We emphasized this in the guidelines as well as in our live sessions.\n\n2. COVID excel dataset had missing column names.\n\n\nStudents will be awarded marks for the 3 questions that required information about new cases and new deaths.\n\n3. Imdb scraping exercise\n\n\nStudents who got the following question and marked \u201cBiography\u201d as answer will be awarded marks.\n\n\nimage\n749\u00d7376 66.6 KB\n\n4.

Timers wrongly timed\n\n\nStudents were informed on multiple occasions that the exam is only for half an hour. The last announcement on TDS RoE about the guidelines also mentioned the same.\n\n6. Is there relative grading?\n\n\nNo not for the RoE.

But my doubt is, there are 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 2 independent senator who caucus with democrats. So, do I have to consider these 2 independent senators as democrats? and count as 50 democrats or only 48 democrats?\n\n\n\n Solved by vikash in post #2\nMarked as solved by rohithsrinivaas\nAs per my understanding independent senator can\u2019t be considered as democrats even if they have voted same.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n76\nviews"

    "text": "21f2000436\n8\nOct 2022\n\nSo, final set of queries from my side:\n\nQ5 and Q15 are they the same?\nQ4 (in the live session it was advised to change yay to nay as it was said it was a typo and final changes in questions will be shared via announcements). So, if we change that then is it the same as Q12 then? Even if Q4 is not changed, does it mean we should take the word \u201cYay\u201d in the question as \u201cYea\u201d as in the HTML webpage?\nRegarding Q12, the question is:\n\nSo I was getting 2 wrong answers when I counted Q12 as number of states where both senators were voting as nay (Which seems to be the right logic if we take the question as is). However, if I simply count the number of senators who voted nay in the entire proceeding, then I get the number of wrongs on the portal reduced to 1 wrong answer only. So could the course team please tell me what is the right question here considering this evaluation by the portal and also if Q4 is modified as well?\nWhat is the significance of the \u201cwrong answer\u201d count on the portal feedback? I know the course team has said quite some times that they are not indicative of anything. But if I change any answer as something that is wrong as per my calculations and then submit it on the portal then the number of \u201cwrong answers\u201d does indeed increase. This does mean that the answers are being checked by the backend, right? And if so, then the question arises what kind of answers should we submit? The reverse engineered ones which satisfy the portal or the ones that are based on the english meaning of the question?\n\nI think @papadelta_5636 had already raised this query on wrong answers in the live session. And the instuctor @rohithsrinivaas sir had said that the questions(all questions that we had doubts in, had some discrepancies with the feedback of wrong answer, typos, etc any kind of errors) will be changed/issues worked upon, etc and the final thing will be notified to us via announcements by Wednesday EOD. But nothing has been sent to us. Not only an announcement but also my query on discourse has not been answered. In the live session, as @papadelta_5636 says (from the 44:45 to the 45:15 minute mark), once the announcement is in, then we can assume that the portal \u201cwrong answer\u201d evaluation is not an indicator of correctness of our answers. And @rohithsrinivaas sir agrees to the same. In view of all this, if the announcement does not come before the deadline, then I will be going through with the following:\n\nQ5 and Q15 are exactly the same. And these questions both mean that we have to count the number of states that had atleast one senator whose vote was \u201cNot Voting\u201d (as per HTML webpage).\nQ4 remains the same. Over here the word \u201cyay\u201d refers to the vote of \u201cYea\u201d as per the HTML webpage. Q4 is not changed to mean \u201cNay\u201d.\nQ12 remains the same where we have to count the number of states where both votes were \u201cNay\u201d.\nThe \u201cwrong answer\u201d feedback shown by the portal is not indicative of anything.\n\nIf the TDS course team thinks that I have made any point that is invalid, needs amendments/if they need any more clarification/discussion on any of these, please let me know so (via reply to this post or a general email/announcement on these doubts) by day after tomorrow(30th October, 6 PM).\n\nIf I do not get a successful resolution of my queries from the course team(and course team alone) on this post via any of the aforementioned communication lines like announcement/reply/email before (30th October, 11 PM), I will assume that all points made by me are valid and approved by the TDS course team. They also approve to the fact that in case I feel there is any kind of discrepancy in my scores in the above stated questions or any other question from the set of questions I am asked to attempt, I have full right to show proof of the same, engage in discussion and request re-evaluation.\n\n@rohithsrinivaas @maheshbalan @Dixon Sir\u2019s I have tagged you to kindly look into this post.\n\n@jkmadathil sir and @Bharathi ma\u2019am ,I am writing this post after much deliberation because my queries were not getting resolved on discourse.\n\nPS: I am sorry if any part of my post appears rude. But I have to frame the post in this way because the TDS course team is not replying to my previous query. And therefore, with the deadline approaching, I feel this is the only feasible way that I can put my views forward and keep proof of the same if any discrepancies arise post results. I hope you understand.

However, we had been advised earlier that test run score is related to error in format etc. However, same marks are given. No actual solutions are given to verify the correctness of marks. Further, it is very interesting to note that when we tried to give answers by putting zero in every question, my marks was showing 90 or 100 in test run. In fact, many of the graded assignments, where we have to submit the answer sheet, are not made aesthetically and their tutorials are also very half heartedly cooked and hardly of any use and student has to learn everything from youtube.\nTherefore, we hope TA will take interest in the problem and take steps to rectify the mistake.\n\nOf late, we are unable to create account in Heroku, as it always showing error.

Ideally saving the text as-is from the books.csv is the best option. However there can be few books that have comma in the original_title (eg , Oxford, The Last Hamlet). For such books as recommended in \u201cTROUBLESHOOT\u201d section in the portal ,\n\n If string answers contain comma, enter the string answer within single quotes, eg 'Third,wave'\n\n\nThis should solve any problem related to string answers. If there are further issues , please raise in discourse\n\nTest Run Score issues. Test score showing 40/100 even if all answers are wrong.\nThe Test Run Score is an indicative score, however not sure how such a scenario can be observed. Request you to share the details over discourse for more clarity\n\nData Cleaning:\nFew cohorts are facing problem with the issue of scores with and without data cleaning. I had been connecting with them to understand the problem . Please raise your concerns in the following thread.\nTDS Sep22 ; Project 2 ; Q12\n\n\n\n2\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n48\nviews\n1\nlink"

Alas it didn\u2019t during the duration of the exam.\nMy phone\u2019s connection was working, so I used it to reply on discourse nearing the end, to see if anything could be done. I even asked should I keep seeya running till net came back up, incase it\u2019ll upload images. After no reply, I ended up closing it.\n\nI truly had no idea what to do because this had never happened to me before in any of the previous SCT and OPPEs (courses in foundation and diploma, with the exception of MLT MLP and TDS I took this semester) I\u2019ve given from home.\n\nI understand that the requirement for the exam (internet connection) was failed from my end.\nBut I had marked and submitted 4-5 answers before this happened. It is my humble request to please consider my record of no issues in previous OPPEs and, at the very least, account for those 4-5 questions in the ROE rather than the direct 0.\n\nI have attached some screenshots I took in the duration. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do.\n\n2022-11-05 (1)\n1366\u00d7768 119 KB\n\n\n2022-11-05 (2)\n1366\u00d7768 95.4 KB\n\n\n2022-11-05 (3)\n1366\u00d7768 177 KB\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n30\nviews"

After \u201cusing\u201d TDS for the last couple of weeks, here is my review.\n\nTDS has the best support group (or non-support group, I am confused!!!) ever. They will support your growth by a new method called \" Non-support induced growth\". This method relies on the principle that a student should grow all by himself without any external help. I remember @Dixon for some of his efforts.\n\nWe need to use excel and python extensively in this course. It is okay to re-use videos explaining excel functions from last term. But it will be a problem when we re-use videos involving python since it\u2019s syntax or even the function will be updated regularly. I have seen many methods explained in the videos not working, because the syntax had changed.\n\nAbout the project 1, it is the same questions for all the terms. But the thing is that even the typos are also carried along, creating a lot of confusion and longer threads. But our course team give predominant importance to point no. 1. Threads with more than 50 comments is not even a sight here.\n\nI believe that this is a good course if we get a course team who enjoys their job and find happiness in helping students. Otherwise this course will be the most easiest and most hated course.\n\n\n\n1 Reply\n9\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n220\nviews\n14\nlikes\n6\nusers"

Although the project was delayed, we had extended the submission deadline by another 4 days. The project has 7 days\u2019 time although the initial plan was to give only 4 days because it requires much less effort.\n\nThere are many questions regarding handling null values, foreign characters and other data issues for calculating the answers to the questions. The course team strongly recommends sticking to and following all the data sanitation procedures discussed in the lecture videos. We do not want to recommend the exact steps to do the same, because the core point in asking those questions is to evaluate if you are able to process data and answer the questions in the correct way. Please restrict yourself to the course videos in terms of handling these issues (e.g. there are videos on doing data processing using excel, etc.)\n\nThe submission file will not be graded in real-time. We take the submission file and grade it offline - so regarding queries on the submission file - please ensure that you stick to the exact format in drafting your answers. The encoding (utf-8) or different encoding doesn\u2019t matter. You can submit it in a format that works for you.

I request course team to introspect and tell that if any normal person was given to read and understand the dataset for each of the question . I am not talking about solving , even to read and understand dataset which a person is seeing for the first time would have taken considerable time and learners were then expected to use tools to arrive at correct options. Given that , and during live interaction session it was told that \u201clearners can try maximum responses and we are not expecting learners to answer all questions\u201d . Keeping that in mind & the fact that inconsistencies during and in exam also caused loss of time, I was surprised to see scoring done out of all 12 questions. It was expected that best 10 or 9 or 8 questions would be taken for scoring. Requesting your comments and thought process on the same.

I have tried it for question 6 and I guess this should work for other questions too.\n\nCreate an excel file where each tab is the four csv files (you can open the csv file and copy the tab to the other file)\nFor these tabs - book_tags, ratings, toread, add two columns called orig_title and title\nUse vlookup to populate these fields from books tab\nCreate a pivot with all the columns (it does not take long time though there are many rows)\nPut orig_title in filters part and filter out blank values (vlookup may put them as zero)\nThen do the calculations as needed - for question 6, it would be the sum of counts column and the max value in that\n\nHope this helps\n\n\n\n3\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n64\nviews"

Please check with the recording too - Live Session for TDS - YouTube\n\nThe folder number is used to randomize the data for the students. Double check that the folder number in the portal number and in the drive link are the same.\n\nFor books that have blank title, remove these book from the other files too.\n\nQ6 - counts column is in book_tags.csv, there are multiple entries for each book, aggregate based on book_id, and then get the sum of the counts and then take the maximum value; use the book_id of that to get the title\n\nQ8 - detailed explanation in discourse - group by tag-id (since tag_id is in multiple rows), then get the least count; use tie-braker as mentioned\n\nQ10. This uses the same algo as question 6. But get the least of the sum. Unlike question 6, the id should be the answer and not the title\n\nQ14 - cut-off is indeed > 0; use textblob module in python (the video uses the same method)\n\nQ16 - Flourish puts the bins in y-axis by default\u2026 You can use either the default bar chart, or change the type to column chart \u2026 No animation is required.

Both of them seem to seek the number of non-voters.\n\nQ.20 seems to be incorrect/incorrectly worded. We can answer this only from the # of reps that participated in this voting from each state. Does that represent the # of reps from each state? Thus, each state has 2 votes from each state; does it mean that there\u2019re only 2 representatives for each state?\n\nI asked because, when I searched on Google, I learned that there are definitely more #reps from each state.\n\nIf there are more #reps in each state, then this data isn\u2019t available to us. Without that, we can\u2019t answer this question.\n\n\n\n2\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\nProject 1 score\n185\nviews\n10\nlikes\n8\nusers"

I\u2019m very very sorry but I am deeply disappointed with this subject. The Google drive that\u2019s supposed to have Colab files from week 4 is empty. I don\u2019t know how to study TDS when the video quality is like this and the Colab files are not available too. The codes are just dictated and not explained. I really don\u2019t understand how can one learn about clusters and things without knowing about supervised and unsupervised ML models and without knowing about ANN, I don\u2019t understand how can one learn about Keras. I was never worried about failing a subject but after seeing the level at which TDS is taught and explained, I am, now and I\u2019m not enjoying it. It was said that MLF is a corequisite of TDS and TDS has no other prerequisite. Clearly. there\u2019s a whole lot of things that are prerequisites for TDS. The instructor says, \u201cThis concept will be familiar to those who have worked with sagemaker .\u201d I\u2019m not sure what about the concept he\u2019s explaining coz I never worked with sagemaker before. With the current situation, the best I can do to pass TDS is to memorize codes coz there\u2019s no other way I can understand it (I\u2019m not new to ML. I\u2019ve done many internships and still a data science intern. Working on it for 2 years now) and I assume that it\u2019s implied, learning it in such shortcut ways to pass exams will help us in no way in the long run.\n\nWhen I learn a coding concept, I want to understand :\ni) Why the particular line is there? What it does to the final output? What will happen without that line?\n\nii) Why a particular parameter is given? What other parameters are available? How the output changes with each parameters?\n\nThis is how Python was taught. Really enjoyed it. The foundation was built and slowly paved our way to the top.\n\nTDS simply feels like starting at the top.\nThis is just a feedback and a kind request to help us.\n\nPlease help us in someway. @course team.\n\n\n\n Solved by ravitejak in post #14\nMarked as solved by alphaeplisonpi\nThanks for raising the concern.

    "text": "Shivamsingh18\nMar 2022\n\nMy specific doubt is on the topic: There is a Q13 in project 2 ( Find the number of books published in the year \u20182000\u2019 based on the \u2018original_publication_year\u2019 [books.csv] ? N) So I have decided to carry out my whole calculation and data pre-processing in both Excel and Colaboratory. In this question with the same dataset excel is giving answer 17 whereas colab is giving answer 18. Why is this happening? Please complete my query ASAP.\nThanks and Regards\n\n\n\n Solved by Anand in post #4\nMarked as solved by Shivamsingh18\nThe other reason could be the pre-processing - either on pandas or Excel. Did you do any after you read the data from the excel/CSV? Maybe, you\u2019ve and didn\u2019t realize it. Try one thing. Use the auto-filter option in excel to filter out only booked published in 2000 and see the count at the bottom\u2026\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n69\nviews"

    "text": "jayxmas\nFeb 2022\n\nHi. I have just received my results for OPPE1 in TDS and the score had been disregarded. According to the summary I just received, it is because I have no log of the time I was on the google meet. This is very upsetting as I was one of the first people to join the call for the verification process. The proctor also allowed us to leave the exam and end the call before the whole exam duration had passed, and I had informed that I would be cutting the call and gotten the approval before I actually left the call. I am unsure if I was logged on for more than 75 minutes, as required, but the difference would be a pittance as I had joined the call 10-15 minutes in advance and was logged in for a whole hour and ten minutes of the exam time.\nHas anyone else faced an issue like this?\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n58\nviews"

I am doing it for the first time and the following is what I wrote (with fictitious names, of course). This is not a part of any assignment or homework.\n\nTo : Charles Ferguson, CEO, Pizzeria\nFrom: Robert November, Marketing Consultant\nDate: --/\u2013/----\nSubject: Comparative Statistical Study Design \u2013 Pizzeria and Pizza Maniacs\n\nThis study design aims at designing a pipeline for data collection and subsequent statistical analysis of the data to help Pizzeria get an edge in the market over their competitor Pizza Maniacs.\nData Collection\nTo obtain sufficient data on the sale of pizza, it is recommended to push feedback notifications while people order online. Manual feedback can be obtained from the people dining in. Questions that need to be included are:\n\nWhat differentiates us from the other pizza chains?\n(a) Crust (b) Variety of Toppings (c) Ambience (d) Fast Delivery\n\nHow satisfied were you with the last order quality?\n(a) Very Satisfied (b) Somewhat Satisfied (c) Not Satisfied (d) Won\u2019t be back again\n\nHow likely are you to recommend us to family or friends?\n(a) 1 (b) 2 (c) 3 (d) 4 (e) 5\n\nHow satisfied were you with the delivery/service staff?\n(a) Very Satisfied (b) Somewhat Satisfied (c) Not Satisfied (d) Won\u2019t be back again\n\nHow did you know about us?\n(a) Social Media (b) Print Media (c) Friends or Family (d) Other\n\nData Analysis\nUniqueness: Based on the data collected, we first need to check for our Unique Selling Proposition (USP) \u2013 that is what differentiates us from the others. Based on this analysis, we need to get better at these or introduce more options. A pie chart is sufficient to analyze this variable.\nCustomer Satisfaction (quality and service): This is an ordinal variable. We need to get the count of these ratings amongst each age group so that we know which age group our pizzas appeal the most to. We can then focus on creating appropriate content and introduce offers that appeal to them. A clustered bar chart should be enough to summarize this data.\nAdvertisement: This is a qualitative variable and should tell us which segment of advertisement brings us the most customers. If an anomaly is observed, like we are spending in a mode of advertisement that would bring little to no customers, it\u2019s better to focus on another segment of advertisement. A scatterplot with the internal data of advertisement spending and the count of the customers that each segment brings us should be enough to understand the issue.\nRecommendation: Although this is an ordinal variable, this can be considered as a ratio variable and the standard deviations of the ratings can be checked. If the standard deviation is high, it means that a certain section is highly unsatisfied or a section is highly satisfied, or both. Suitable changes can be implemented after further investigation of the issue.\nAdvertisement:\nOur advertisement needs to address these issues graphically so that people know what we are better at. A clustered bar chart of our food items\u2019 categorical popularity in contrast with our competitors would definitely appeal to the masses. Based on the data collected, the advertisement should also mention fast delivery times and the margins by which we deliver before others. Color combination and other design factors can be fixated on the age group we are trying to appeal to.\nAny constructive feedback from instructors or my fellow learners will be highly appreciated.\nThanks in advance\nAbhik Biswas\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\u200b\nReply\n68\nviews"

You can expect it to be available in Week 6. It will definitely be easier and more helpful if you have a very basic knowledge of the tool.
